*******************************************************************************

In my simulation, I will have 2 types of threads: a passenger thread and a 
train thread. Train threads will run until all passengers have reached their 
final destination stations. Passenger threads will run until they reach their 
final destination

The simulation contains two types of locks: station locks and passenger locks.
Each station will have their own lock that handles the arrival and departure
of trains. Only one train can hold a given station lock at a time, ensuring 
that only one train is at a station at a time. Each train will have it's own
passenger lock which handles boarding and deboarding, and train movement.
Passengers may only board/deboard if they hold the passenger lock and the
train can only move if it has the passenger lock and the lock of it's next
station.
